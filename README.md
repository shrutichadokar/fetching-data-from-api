# fetching-data-from-api
In this project, I wrote a Python script to iterate over multiple pages of top-rated movies provided by the TMDB API. The script fetched movie data, processed it, and then combined all the data into a single CSV file for further analysis or use

Python: Used for scripting and data manipulation.
Pandas: For data handling and creating the DataFrame.
Requests: For making HTTP requests to the TMDB API.
TMDB API: https://developers.themoviedb.org/ - Leveraged this API to get movie data.
JSON Viewer: http://jsonviewer.stack.hu/ - Utilized this tool for viewing and debugging JSON responses.
